Magnetic Rigidity Calculator – Read Me

This application allows users to:

    Select an isotope from a full list of naturally occurring and stable elements.

    Input the charge state of the particle (as the number of electrons removed).

    Enter the kinetic energy of the particle in MeV.

    Calculate the magnetic rigidity (Bρ) using the selected parameters.

    Display the relativistic beta (β) and gamma (γ) values of the ion.

    Ideal for use in cyclotron tuning, beam transport design, and ion optics simulations.
